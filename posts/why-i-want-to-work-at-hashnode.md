I do my best work when I understand the scope of the problem or feature and have the liberty to explore, solve and create. Autonomy is important, but not as important as a collaborative culture - everyone has something to learn, and I believe it’s each developer’s responsibility to both share their expertise and be taught from others.

Why do I want to work at Hashnode? The answer is simple, actually. Individuals prove to be the most happy and productive when they are contributing to something they believe in.

This goes for me and Hashnode. I use Hashnode almost daily - reading content from a vibrant community and posting my own articles through the service as well.

Coming from a background in consulting, I understand how to develop a product that supports thousands of users while interfacing directly with a client to understand feature requirements.

I love Hashnode. It’s a platform that I admire and nothing would give me more purpose than to have the opportunity to help evolve the service I love using!
